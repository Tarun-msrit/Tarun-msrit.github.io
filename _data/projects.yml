    I did this project as my mini-project in 3rd year. The outline of this project is taking input of News headline articles and summarizing it in 1 or 2 sentences by abstractive text summarization. We have used recurrent neural networks for this and specifically LSTM(Long short term memory) to acheive this.
    We've also scored our model based on different parameters.
