    Did this project as my mini-project in 3rd year. The outline of this project is taking input of News headline articles and summarizing it in 1 or 2 sentences by abstractive text summarization. We have used recurrent neural networks for this and specifically LSTM(Long short term memory) to acheive this.<br>
    We've also scored our model based on different parameters.

    I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
